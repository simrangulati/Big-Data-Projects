To monitor water quality across europe and draw actionable insights using data from europe

# Data 

We have millions of data

## Big Data Classification Scenarios

### Scenario-Based Questions: Does 1 Million Records = Big Data?

**Scenario 1: Simple Water Quality Measurements**
- **Data**: 1 million records of basic water quality measurements (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen)
- **Question**: Is this big data?
- **Analysis**: Likely NOT big data - simple structure, manageable with traditional databases and tools like Excel or standard SQL databases

**Scenario 2: Real-time Sensor Networks**
- **Data**: 1 million records generated every hour from 10,000 sensors across Europe
- **Question**: Is this big data?
- **Analysis**: YES - High velocity (real-time streaming), requires specialized tools for processing and storage

**Scenario 3: Multi-format Environmental Data**
- **Data**: 1 million records including:
  - Structured sensor data
  - Satellite imagery
  - Weather station reports
  - Social media posts about water quality
  - Government regulatory documents
- **Question**: Is this big data?
- **Analysis**: YES - High variety of data formats requires big data tools for integration and analysis

**Scenario 4: Historical Archive**
- **Data**: 1 million water quality records collected over 50 years, stored in CSV files
- **Question**: Is this big data?
- **Analysis**: Borderline - Volume is manageable, but temporal analysis and pattern recognition might benefit from big data approaches

**Scenario 5: Predictive Modeling Dataset**
- **Data**: 1 million records with 500+ features each (chemical compounds, environmental factors, geographic data)
- **Question**: Is this big data?
- **Analysis**: YES - Complexity and dimensionality make it challenging for traditional analytics tools

### Key Takeaways:
- **Volume alone doesn't define big data**
- **Context matters**: 1M records can be big data if:
  - Generated at high velocity (streaming)
  - Contains variety of formats
  - Requires complex processing
  - Traditional tools struggle with analysis
- **The 3 V's Framework**: Volume, Velocity, Variety
- **Processing complexity** often determines if big data tools are needed

### Discussion Questions:
1. At what point does your water quality dataset become "big data"?
2. How would you handle 1 million records arriving every minute?
3. What tools would you choose for different scenarios above?
4. How does geographic distribution of data affect big data classification?
