- Need real-time pollution detection
- Historical trend analysis required

**Questions:**
1. Is this volume manageable with traditional tools?
2. Can a single database server handle the concurrent writes?
3. What about geographic distribution of sensors?

**Answer:** ü§î **Borderline - Traditional tools can work with optimization**

- 10,000 sensors reporting every 5 seconds
- 172.8 million readings per day
- Real-time leak detection and pressure monitoring
- Predictive maintenance algorithms
- Integration with weather data and usage patterns

**Questions:**
1. Can traditional databases handle 172M+ records per day?
2. What about real-time processing for leak detection?
3. How would you handle sensor failures and data gaps?

**Answer:** ‚ùå **Requires Big Data approaches**
- Need distributed storage (Cassandra, HBase)
- Stream processing (Kafka, Apache Storm)
- Real-time analytics platforms
- Microservices architecture

## **Scenario 4: IoT Home Water Monitor**
**Context:** Individual household water quality monitor for personal use.

**Data Characteristics:**
- 1 sensor with 5 measurements every 5 minutes
- 1,440 readings per day
- Mobile app notifications
- Cloud backup optional

**Questions:**
1. What's the simplest technical solution?
2. Does this need real-time processing at all?
3. Local vs cloud processing trade-offs?

**Answer:** ‚úÖ **Traditional tools (even simpler)**
- SQLite local database
- Simple mobile app with basic alerts
- Optional cloud sync with REST API
- No need for complex real-time processing

## **Scenario 6: European Water Quality Network**
**Context:** Cross-border water quality monitoring for EU environmental compliance.

**Data Characteristics:**
- 50,000 sensors across 27 countries
- Multi-language data and regulatory requirements
- Various sensor types and data formats
- Integration with satellite imagery and weather data
- Real-time pollution tracking across borders

**Questions:**
1. How do you handle data sovereignty and privacy laws?
2. What about different data formats from different countries?
3. Can traditional tools scale to this geographic distribution?

**Answer:** ‚ùå **Definitely requires Big Data infrastructure**
- Distributed data processing across regions
- Multiple data formats require big data integration tools
- Real-time cross-border analytics
- Compliance with GDPR and various national regulations
