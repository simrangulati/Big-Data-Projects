## Key Principle: Start Simple, Scale Smart

**Remember:** The goal isn't to use the most advanced technology - it's to solve your problem effectively!

- **Start with traditional tools** when they meet your needs
- **Scale up gradually** as requirements grow
- **Don't over-engineer** for theoretical future needs
- **Consider team expertise** and maintenance costs
- **Big data tools add complexity** - only use when necessary

Traditional tools are often the right choice, and there's no shame in using them. They're proven, well-understood, and cost-effective for many real-world scenarios!
